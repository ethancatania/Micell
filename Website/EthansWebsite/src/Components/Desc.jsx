             <p className='wpi'> I am a proud graduate of Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where I earned my bachelor's degree in computer science and graduated with distinction honors.
            From my twelve years playing all levels of football to creating and teaching a digital literacy curriculum for high school level students in a rural Namibian
            after-school program, I have had a very diverse and valuable journey to become the person I am today. </p>

            <p className='serve'> I have always loved sports and have been involved in at  least three sports for the majority of my life, often in a leadership role. I have also spent the last six years
                working at a local restaurant, progressing from busser to host, then food runner, and finally server. Over the past two years of serving, I have honed my people skills
                and adaptability to difficult situations. Serving has also allowed me to observe a large sample size of people and what they consider good service. I have learned
                to provide experiences for individuals rather than provide a cookie-cutter transaction, as most restaurants have become today. </p>
