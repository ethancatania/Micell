            <p> I am a proud graduate of Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where I earned my bachelor's degree in computer science and graduated with distinction honors.
            From my twelve years playing all levels of football to creating and teaching a digital literacy curriculum for high school level students in a rural Namibian
            after-school program, I have had a very diverse and valuable journey to become the person I am today. </p>

            <p> I have always loved sports and have been involved in at  least three sports for the majority of my life, often in a leadership role. I have also spent the last six years
                working at a local restaurant, progressing from busser to host, then food runner, and finally server. Over the past two years of serving, I have honed my people skills
                and adaptability to difficult situations. Serving has also allowed me to observe a large sample size of people and what they consider good service. I have learned
                to provide experiences for individuals rather than provide a cookie-cutter transaction, as most restaurants have become today. </p>

            <p> I enjoy working hard and going above and beyond to earn my paycheck, a joy that is abundantly present since my main form of income is tips. Although I have enjoyed my
                current job, I have always had an affinity for math and science, a rare skill in the restaurant industry. I initially started my college journey as an electrical and
                computer engineer because I knew I wanted to be involved in computers. It was not until my sophomore year that I had even heard about computer science.
                I had done Scratch-like programming whilst in elementary school but never imagined the power coding and understanding computing could bring. I decided to take an
                introductory coding class and was immediately enthralled by the seemingly simplistic nature of coding while also craving the challenge of a notoriously difficult major.
                I have always enjoyed challenging myself and seeing how I measure up. I thrive proportionately to the difficulty of the challenge ahead of me. My journey has allowed
                me to develop a strong sense of teamwork, technical expertise, a love for challenges, and a commitment to providing quality to as many people as possible.
